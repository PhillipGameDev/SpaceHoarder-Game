# Space Hoarder

**Space is running out, literally…**  
For a large junkyard ship to escape from a space anomaly, you must get rid of all extra weight that’s no longer useful, and it is a LOT. Be fast enough to compact and incinerate the wreckage that comes at you and avoid getting buried.

Space Hoarder is our game for the [**Ludum Dare 42**](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42) #LDJAM #LDJAM42 occurred in August 2018.
